baywheels (formally know as Ford GoBike) is a regional public bicycle sharing systems in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is one of the first of its kind and as been established since August 2013. Its bicycles are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week for periods ranging from a single ride (up to 30 minutes) to a day pass or customers can purchase an annual subscription which gives them unlimited rides up to 45 minutes in duration. It has approximately 2600 number of vehicles  but is expected to expand to 7000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville and San Jose.
The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consist of daily individual trip data from mid 2017 to June 2020. 


Summary Of Findings 

----------

What was found are the different patterns from the two different users. The main user are the subscribers which would be commuters. They have shorter trips and mostly use the bike during the week. Where the other user which are the customers would use the bike more during the weekends and have longer rides. Because the customers would normally be the tourist that would visit the city. In general customers would ride the bike an extra 3/4 minutes compared to the subscribers and would be the ones that do the longest trips as well. The busiest time of the day would be during the rush hours, 7AM to 9AM in the morning and 4PM to 6PM later in the afternoon. And what was interesting is how the health climate as changed the patterns in this 2020 year. Customers have been the main customers due to more subscribers working from home. 

Key Insights


----------

The biggest insights is the pattern from the two type of riders. From the usage pattern weekdays and weekends but also to the amount of time they use the bike. However one of the biggest hurdle they may encounter correlates with the health climate that has hit the world. More people working from home will take a big chunk of the usual users and having less tourist will also take customers away. They might want to play the long game and hope everything goes back to normal or change their core customer because we might actually never go back to normal.
